# Contributing

Want to help? Great! This is a fun project to hack on because it's relatively simple. It's a good way to get acquainted with async Rust and Rust in general. You'll find lots of project ideas on the [issues page](https://github.com/optopodi/optopodi/issues).

## Code of conduct

We follow the [Rust code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). Please report any concerns to a [Lead][leads].

## Optopodi Collaboration Guidelines

Adopted from the [Mentored Sprints](https://www.mentored-sprints.dev) discord server and [The Recurse Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules) these guidelines extend the [Rust CoC](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) in ways that are actionable and clear examples to follow for the Optopodi team.

Examples of unacceptable behaviors by participants include:

* Being friendly and patient  
* Using welcoming and inclusive language  
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:
  
* The use of sexualised or violent language or imagery
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

The following are examples of good choices during collaboration with your team and choices to avoid.  The Recurse Center did such an excellent job creating these examples that addition explanation is not needed.

**These guidelines aren’t for punishing people.**

Consider these guidelines to be lightweight. You should not be afraid of breaking one. These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, "hey, you just feigned surprise," or "that’s subtly sexist," don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on. 

**Inclusive Language**  https://heyguys.cc/

  Do use these terms: everyone, everybody, all, you all, y'all, folks, friends, people.

⛔️ Do not use "guys"

*No well-actually’s*

>Alice: I just installed Linux on my computer!
>Bob: It’s actually called GNU/Linux.

*No feigning surprise*

>Dan: What’s the command line?
>Carol: Wait, you’ve never used the command line?

*No backseat driving*

>Bob: What’s the name of the string copy function?
>Alice: Strncpy.
>Eve: (injecting into an existing conversation) You should use strlcpy. It’s safer.

*No subtle -isms*

>Carol: Windows is hard to use.
>Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.

**And finally, not every comment requires a response.**

## Chat

We chat on the github-metrics Zulip instance, found at <https://github-metrics.zulipchat.com/>.

## Review policies

- Anyone is welcome to leave a review.
- We use [bors], so don't merge by hand. If you are a reviewer, type `bors r+` instead.
- Only r+ code that you are familiar with.
- Style nits and other minor concerns are welcome, but please be courteous. Labeling things as "nit" or including a comment that makes clear that these are minor points can be helpful.

[bors]: https://bors.tech/

## Committers

Committer access is recognition of "significant contribution". Significant contribution represents several hours of work over multiple days:

- Implementing a moderate feature
- Non-trivial refactorings
- Issue triage and general participation
- Reviewing the code of others

Committers are expected to go "above and beyond" with respect to the Code of Conduct.

Committers have write access to the repository and r+ rights on bors.

## Leads

[leads]: https://github.com/orgs/optopodi/teams/leads

Leads of the project have final decision in case of controversy. They also make membership decisions, such as who to add or remove from the committers group.

Leads are selected from committers based on a history of major contribution and committment.
